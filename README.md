# 🧠 MindMarket – The Micro-Idea Marketplace

## 📌 Problem Statement

Every day, people come up with creative ideas — app names, product taglines, startup hooks — but most of these micro-ideas go to waste. There’s no platform that helps individuals share, showcase, or monetize raw creativity without building a full product or service.

MindMarket solves this by creating a marketplace for imagination.

## 💡 What is MindMarket?

MindMarket is a platform where users can submit and sell short creative ideas like app names, taglines, or product concepts. These ideas are evaluated and enhanced by AI, making them easier to find, buy, or build upon.

It’s like Fiverr, but instead of offering full services, users trade in quick, clever ideas.
